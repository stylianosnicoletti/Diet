# Diet
Using AngularJS Javascript Framework, Bootstramp Web Framework and phpMyAdmin Administration Tool, I created a website that can be used as a calorie counter and as a meal planner. Firstly you need to create your list of foods, which can be edited at any time. Then you can easily register and track your food intake daily, respecting your carbohydrate, protein and fat targets. You can also get a graphical summary of your overall macronutrient ratios, together with your average calorie intake.
